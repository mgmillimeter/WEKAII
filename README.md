## Abstract

Student academic performance is shaped by a complex interaction of socioeconomic, educational, and behavioral factors. This study applies a multivariate data mining approach to examine how these variables jointly influence secondary school student performance in Bangladesh. Using the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework, the research involved data selection, preprocessing, transformation through feature engineering and one-hot encoding, followed by model development and evaluation. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle was analyzed using three machine learning classification algorithms: Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among the models, Random Forest achieved the highest classification accuracy (77.95%), followed by SVM (77.57%) and Decision Tree (75.78%). Across all models, academic track (Science or Commerce), study time, and attendance consistently emerged as the strongest predictors of academic performance, while variables such as extracurricular activities, parental involvement, and internet access contributed more modestly. Parental education and employment showed limited direct influence in the models. The findings offer both theoretical contributions to educational data mining literature and practical insights for designing targeted interventions that support student learning through academic engagement and behavioral support.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Understanding the multifactorial influences on student academic performance is crucial for developing evidence-based educational policies. While innate ability contributes to academic success, socioeconomic and educational factors play substantial roles. This study investigates how parental education, employment, family size, geographic location, study time, attendance, tutoring, extracurricular activities, and internet access influence academic outcomes among secondary school students in Bangladesh. The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework was employed, involving selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation phases. A structured dataset was extracted from Kaggle, followed by thorough data cleaning, outlier treatment, feature engineering, and multivariate classification using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. The Decision Tree classifier demonstrated superior performance with 77.7% accuracy, identifying academic group, study time, and attendance as the most significant predictors. The findings contribute to the educational data mining literature and offer practical implications for policymakers and educational institutions in tailoring targeted academic interventions.

## 1.1 Background and Problem Statement

Academic performance is widely regarded as a multidimensional outcome shaped by numerous interacting factors. Beyond cognitive ability, research highlights the role of external determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES), parental education, school environment, and student habits in influencing learning outcomes (Sirin, 2005; OECD, 2019). These factors are particularly significant in developing countries, where educational inequalities often mirror broader socioeconomic disparities. Bangladesh, like many developing nations, faces challenges in ensuring equitable access to quality education. Policymakers and educators require evidence-based insights to better understand how various social, familial, and institutional factors influence student achievement. Despite numerous studies investigating individual influences, limited research explores the combined, multivariate effects of these variables. Therefore, adopting multivariate analytical approaches becomes essential to reveal complex interdependencies often missed by traditional univariate methods.

## 1.2 Existing Literature

Previous studies have consistently found strong links between parental education and student achievement (Coleman et al., 1966; Sirin, 2005). Hanushek and Woessmann (2011) emphasized that family background heavily influences school readiness and learning outcomes. Moreover, Romero and Ventura (2010) highlighted the emerging role of educational data mining as an effective tool to model such complex educational phenomena. Other studies have examined the impact of school-level variables like school type, attendance, and tutoring availability (OECD, 2019). For example, Siemens and Baker (2012) demonstrated how learning analytics can be applied to uncover patterns in student engagement and performance. However, few studies have simultaneously examined the interaction of multiple socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional variables on academic success within the Bangladeshi educational context.

## 1.3 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are:
1. To analyze how socioeconomic and educational factors influence student academic performance.
2. To examine the combined effects of parental education, employment, family size, study habits, school type, attendance, and extracurricular participation.
3. To apply multivariate classification techniques using the KDD process to extract meaningful patterns.

## 1.4 Research Significance

This study provides actionable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to improve academic outcomes through data-informed interventions. By adopting a multivariate perspective, the study advances both academic literature and practical applications in educational data mining, contributing to more targeted, evidence-based policy formulation in Bangladesh.

1. Data Source
- The dataset was obtained from Kaggleâ€™s Bangladesh Student Performance EDA repository. The data integrates school records and student survey responses.

2. Variables of Interest
- Dependent Variables: Academic subject scores (English, Math, Science, Social Science, Art & Culture), Total Score, and derived Performance Category (Low, Average, High).
- Independent Variables: Socioeconomic and educational factors, including parental education, parental job, family size, location, study time, attendance, tutoring, extracurricular activities, internet access, guardian type, and student group.

3. Data Extraction
- File type: CSV (Comma-Separated Values); Extraction method: Direct download; Sample size: 8,608 student records (after cleaning).

## 2.2 Preprocessing (Data Cleaning)

1. Missing Values
- Only one missing value was identified (in location).
  
Action Taken:
- filled missing location with "Urban" (the most common value in dataset).

2. Duplicate and Inconsistent Records
- No duplicate rows detected.

Action Taken:
- Inconsistencies in categorical values (e.g., Hons vs. Honors, urban vs. Urban) were standardized.

3. Outliers
- Outlier detection applied using the Interquartile Range (IQR method, 1.5 Ã— IQR rule). The Interquartile Range (IQR) method detects outliers by measuring data spread. Calculate the IQR (Q3 - Q1) and set lower/upper bounds at **Q1 - 1.5Ã—IQR** and **Q3 + 1.5Ã—IQR**. Data points outside these bounds are flagged as outliers. A simple, robust rule for identifying extreme values in skewed or non-normal distributions.

_Table 1: Quantified summary of outliers detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method_

| Variable         | Normal | Outlier |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `english`        | 8610   | 1       |
| `math`           | 8609   | 2       |
| `science`        | 8611   | 0       |
| `social_science` | 8611   | 0       |
| `art_culture`    | 8610   | 1       |
| `attendance`     | 8611   | 0       |
| `age`            | 8482   | 129     |

Interpretation: Most variables have very few outliers, except for age, which has 129 outliers. Ages like 10 and 24 are quite unusual for secondary students.
Majority of "outliers" are simply 19 years old, which seems acceptable.

Actions Taken:
- Keep 19-year-old records â€” likely valid senior secondary students.
- Remove extreme age outliers: Remove rows where age < 13 or age > 20 â€” beyond the typical secondary education range.
- For other variables (english, math, art_culture): The number of outliers is negligible (1â€“2 records).

_Table 2: Detecting Outlier Summary_

| Description                         | Count |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| Original Rows                       | 8611  |
| Rows Removed (Extreme Age Outliers) | 3     |
| Final Rows After Cleaning           | 8608  |

- Only 3 records had extreme ages (below 13 or above 20) and were removed.
- All other outliers in subject scores were retained since they were minimal and likely reflect genuine performance.

4. Normalization
- Normalization was not applied because the selected models (such as Decision Trees and Random Forests) are not sensitive to the scale or range of the input values. These algorithms make decisions based on data splits rather than mathematical distances, allowing them to handle variables with different units or magnitudes without requiring normalization.
  
## 2.3 Transformation (Feature Engineering)
1. Derived Variables
To enhance the dataset for predictive modeling, two key derived variables were created:

Total Score (total_score):
This variable represents the studentâ€™s overall academic performance, calculated by summing the scores across five subjects:
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d4f799-d723-405c-9ceb-ebb8bf22b2b3)

where _Si_ corresponds to the score in one of the individual subjects.
- Performance Category (performance_category):
  
To convert the continuous total scores into discrete classes suitable for classification tasks, the 20th and 80th percentiles of the total score distribution were used as cut-off points:

- Low Performance: total score â‰¤ 20th percentile

- Average Performance: total score > 20th percentile and < 80th percentile

- High Performance: total score â‰¥ 80th percentile

This method helps ensure that each category contains a sufficient and relatively balanced number of cases. Using percentiles also accounts for the data's actual distribution, rather than applying arbitrary fixed thresholds, which improves both the interpretability and performance of classification models.

2. Encoding
- Categorical variables, such as parental education, guardian type, and school group, were converted into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding to allow machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. This technique creates separate binary columns for each category, preserving all available information without introducing artificial ranking. Since the number of features remained reasonable after encoding, dimensionality reduction was not necessary, allowing the models to consider all relevant factors during analysis.

3. Dimensionality Reduction
- Dimensionality reduction techniques were not applied since the total number of features remained relatively small and manageable. Retaining all available variables allowed the models to consider as much information as possible without risking overfitting or excessive computational complexity.

## 2.4 Data Mining (Pattern Extraction)
1. Models Applied:
- Three classification algorithms were implemented to predict student performance: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models were selected to provide a balance between interpretability (Decision Tree), robustness (Random Forest), and non-linear classification capabilities (SVM).

2. Evaluation:
- An 80/20 stratified train-test split was applied to maintain class proportions across both training and testing sets. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and F1-score to capture both overall correctness and performance across all classes. Feature importance was extracted from tree-based models to identify key predictors contributing to student performance outcomes.

## 2.5 Interpretation & Evaluation
- The Decision Tree model identified Academic Group, Study Time, and Attendance as the most influential predictors of student performance. Model performance was validated through comparison across multiple classifiers, demonstrating consistent results. Visualizations, including decision trees and feature importance plots, were generated to enhance interpretability and support the understanding of key patterns within the data.

The most influential predictors of student performance are studytime, stu_group, and attendance, indicating that academic habits and chosen academic track strongly affect outcomes. Socio-demographic variables contribute only marginally to performance prediction.

3.2 Discussion Based on the KDD Process

Step 1: Selection (Data Collection)
- The dataset provided relevant academic, demographic, and socioeconomic information on Bangladeshi secondary students, suitable for investigating performance prediction. As the data was obtained from Kaggle, it may not fully represent the entire national student population, and some self-reported variables may introduce minor inaccuracies.

Step 2: Preprocessing (Data Cleaning)
- Data cleaning addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure reliability. Mode imputation was used for categorical missing values, while unrealistic age values were filtered out. Categorical variables were converted into numerical format through one-hot encoding to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

Step 3: Transformation (Feature Engineering)
- A new target variable, performance category, was created to group students based on academic performance levels, facilitating multi-class classification. After encoding, the number of features remained manageable, and no dimensionality reduction was necessary.

Step 4: Data Mining (Key Findings from Analysis)
- Three classification algorithms were applied: Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among them, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (77.95%), followed closely by SVM (77.57%) and J48 (75.78%). Feature importance analysis using Information Gain identified studytime, academic group, and attendance as the most influential predictors of student performance. In contrast, many socioeconomic factors such as parental education, job status, and family size contributed minimally to prediction accuracy.

Step 5: Interpretation & Evaluation
- The findings highlight that studentsâ€™ study habits, choice of academic track, and consistent attendance play a more significant role in academic success than most background characteristics. These results suggest that educational interventions focusing on improving study discipline, appropriate academic guidance, and attendance monitoring may yield meaningful improvements in student outcomes. However, limitations include the restricted scope of available features, the absence of psychological or motivational factors, and potential sample bias. Future research may benefit from more comprehensive datasets and the integration of additional variables to capture a fuller picture of academic performance drivers.

## 4. Conclusion

- This study examined the combined influence of socioeconomic and educational factors on the academic performance of secondary school students in Bangladesh using the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework. By applying three machine learning classification modelsâ€”Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machineâ€”key predictors of student performance were identified. Among these, study time, academic track (Commerce or Science), and attendance emerged as the most influential factors across models, while extracurricular participation, parental involvement, and guardianship showed smaller but positive effects. Parental education, occupation, and other demographic variables demonstrated limited direct predictive power. These findings provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers seeking to design targeted interventions. The multivariate, data-driven approach applied here contributes to the growing field of educational data mining, highlighting the potential of predictive modeling to inform student-centered educational policies.

## 5. Recommendations

For Educational Institutions and Policymakers

- Interventions should prioritize students in Commerce tracks who exhibit lower study time and poor attendance. Programs that strengthen study habits and time management may help improve academic outcomes. Attendance monitoring systems should be reinforced to promote consistent school participation. Schools may also consider expanding extracurricular activities to increase student engagement, while actively involving parents in supporting their children's academic progress.

For Future Research

- Future studies should consider larger, nationally representative datasets to enhance generalizability. Incorporating psychological and motivational factors may offer deeper insights into non-cognitive contributors to student performance. Applying more advanced analytical techniques such as ensemble methods, neural networks, and longitudinal analyses may further improve predictive accuracy. Cross-country or regional comparative studies could also be conducted to assess the external validity of these findings.
